Global scope, local scope, and lexical scope are all common variable scopes.

Static typing means that type checking is done at compile time. Languages with static typing often require you to explicitly declare variable types, or the compiler infers the type.

The main difference lies in memory management.

Explicit type conversion (casting) is used to change the data type of a value, often to convert from a larger type to a smaller type, or to reinterpret the underlying data.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
